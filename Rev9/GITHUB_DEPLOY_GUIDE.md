# 📋 GitHub + Render Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1. Push to GitHub Repository
```bash
# Option A: New Repository
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Hotel PMS Rev9 - Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/hotel-pms-rev9.git
git push -u origin main

# Option B: Existing Repository  
git add Rev9/
git commit -m "Add Hotel PMS Rev9 for Render deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Connect to Render.com
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) and sign up/login
2. Click **"New"** → **"Web Service"** 
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Choose the repository containing Rev9

### 3. Configure & Deploy
```bash
# Render Configuration:
Name: hotel-pms-rev9
Root Directory: / (or /Rev9 if subfolder)
Runtime: Python 3
Build Command: ./build.sh
Start Command: gunicorn hotel_pms.wsgi:application
```

**That's it! Render handles the rest automatically.**

## ⚙️ Render Environment Variables

These are automatically handled by `render.yaml`:

```env

# Customizable
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin

## 🔄 Automatic Deployment Workflow

### What Happens on Git Push:
1. **GitHub** receives your code changes
2. **Render** detects the push automatically
3. **Build Process** runs (`build.sh`):
   - Installs Python dependencies
   - Collects static files
   - Runs database migrations
   - Initializes hotel data
4. **Deployment** starts with zero downtime
5. **Your App** is live at `https://your-app.onrender.com`

### Timeline Features Deploy:
- ✅ Room type grouping (Loft, Single, Double, Triple)
- ✅ 2-week booking timeline
- ✅ Color-coded reservations
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design
- ✅ Real-time statistics
- ✅ Interactive booking management

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Build Fails
```bash
# Check Render logs for errors
# Common fixes:
chmod +x build.sh  # Make build script executable
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Test locally first
```

### Database Issues
```bash
# Ensure PostgreSQL service is created first
# Verify DATABASE_URL is connected
# Check migration logs in Render
```

### Static Files Not Loading
```bash
# Verify collectstatic runs in build.sh
# Check STATIC_ROOT setting
# Ensure whitenoise is configured
```

### Timeline Not Working
```bash
# Check browser console for JS errors
# Verify room data initialized
# Test timeline URL directly
```
